            <p>Hello traveler, what are you doing in such a shady place?</p>
            <p>Take a seat, be comfortable. Just try not to touch anything. Can I get you a cup of coffee? Don't you like coffee? Well, never mind...</p>
            <p>Have you seen the sign out there? Did you like it? Please, say you did... You know, it took me some time to do it... So, did you like it? What? Do you think it's too dark in here? No, I won't open the windows, I don't have any.</p> <!-- Make light mode someday-->
            <p>So, what are you doing so far from home? Do you want to know who I am? Well, I'm not telling you this. I already let you in. Anyway, there's a room full of information about me!</p> <!-- Add link to about me-->
            <p>Oh, you must be wondering what are these signs on the side. Well, there's a funny story about them. Do you want to know the story? What story? What are you talking about? The signs? What about them? Oh, they're just some things I like. To be fair, I don't like them all the same. Well, don't judge me, what father doesn't have a favorite son? Anyway, the kinda glow, you know? You're not seeing it, just get a little closer.</p>
            <p>I think it's time for you to go, you know, keep your travel, or whatever, I have my stuff to deal with. If you want to visit any of the other rooms you can do by your own. Just remember, don't touch anything.</p>
