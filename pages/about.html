                    My name is Luan Rafael Pozzobon, but call me whatever you want! I was born on November
                    11<sup>th</sup>, 2004, in Curitiba PR, BRAZIL, where I still live. In 2022, when I was 17 years old,
                    I got into the college, pursuing a bachelor's in Computer Science. Also, since the beginning of
                    college I have been doing some online courses, and a little later started to build some personal
                    projects, if you want to see some of them, please visit my

                <p>Why Tech?</p><br>
                <p id="content">If you're wondering why I chose to work with tech, trust me I also don't know. Just
                    kidding, since I was in school, I always wanted to work with something related to tech, initially I
                    wanted to work with hardware, but after some time I gave up idea, (and I'm kinda glad I did). On the
                    beginning of college, I decided to focus on the development area, and I ended up looking more to
                    backend.

                <p>Let's Start from the Beginning</p>
                <p id="content">As soon as I started college, I was learning to program, and I decided to look for some
                    online courses, and I found a free Python course, so all I was doing in college, I would also
                    make using Python. In the second semester, I was learning C at college, and I left Python totally
                    aside for some time, and when I came back I didn't like Python anymore, so I decided also that I
                    should focus on something, so I went to look for another online course, focused on front-end, and
                    even though I didn't like to make front-end, mostly because of CSS, I kept for some time learning
                    front-end because I thought it would be easier to get a job, but I didn't go too far. And finally
                    when I decided again to change my focus, I had the idea of one project, and I wanted some day to go
                    to mobile, mostly focused on Android, that's when I started to learn Java, initially for back-end,
                    and that's where I stayed, after this time, I started hating front-end a little bit less, and
                    recently I decided to have some adventures with it.

                <p>What am I looking for?</p>
                <p id="content">At this moment I'm looking for my graduation and also trying to find an internship or a
                    job opportunity. Looking a little forward, I want to try on different areas, mostly on development
                    area, as GameDev, Fullstack, and even approach more to Cybersec. And for the bigger timeline, I want
                    to become a great person in this area, and make big things, build tools to help humanity.</p>
