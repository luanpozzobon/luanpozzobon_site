        <p>Hmm... Hi... You came? Let's start then. I'm kinda nervous, you know. I mean no one's ever came here before.
            I don't really know how to act!</p>
        <p>Ok... Where do I begin? Right... See those signs below? You can grab them and find out more! Now I'll have to leave you. You know, a lot of things to do!</p>

                <p id="content">My name is Luan Rafael Pozzobon, but you can call me just Luan, or whatever you want!
                    I was born in November 11<sup>th</sup>, 2004, in Curitiba PR, BRAZIL, where I
                    still live. Currently I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Also, since the
                    beggining of the college I'm doing some online courses, and a little later started to build some
                    personal projects, if you want to see some of them, please visit my <a

                <p>Why Tech?</p><br>
                <p id="content">I used to like gaming, and always looked at tech, and really liked it. I also used to
                    like math and physics. As I started college I've been looking more to the development area, with a
                    bigger focus in Backend, this site is actually one of my first adventures with Frontend.</p>

                <p>What am I looking for?</p>
                <p id="content">At this moment I'm looking for my graduation, and also trying to find a internship or a
                    job opportunity. Looking a little forward, I want to try on different areas, most on development
                    area, as GameDev, Fullstack, and even approach more to Cybersec. And for the bigger timeline, I want
                    to become a great person in this area, and make big things, build tools to help the humanity.</p>
