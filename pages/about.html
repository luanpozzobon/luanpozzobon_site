        <p>Hmm... Hi... You came? Let's start then. I'm kinda nervous, you know. I mean no one's ever came here before.
            I don't really know how to act!</p>
        <p>Ok... Where do I begin? Right... See those signs below? You can grab them and find out more! Now I'll have to

                <p id="content">My name is Luan Rafael Pozzobon, but you can call me just Luan, or whatever you want!
                    I was born in November 11<sup>th</sup>, 2004, in Curitiba PR, BRAZIL, where I
                    still live. Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Also, since the
                    beginning of college I have been doing some online courses, and a little later started to build some
                    personal projects, if you want to see some of them, please visit my <a

                <p>Why Tech?</p><br>
                <p id="content">I used to like gaming, and always looked at tech, and really liked it. I also used to
                    like math and physics. As I started college I've been looking more into the development area, with a
                    bigger focus in Backend, this site is actually one of my first adventures with Frontend.</p>

                <p>Let's Start from the Beginning</p>
                <p id="content">The first language I looked for, when I was already at college was Python, because it
                    was popular and everyone used to say it was easy. I never really liked though. On the second
                    semester I started to study C, so I just left Python aside, and when I came back again, I decided I
                    had to trace some path, so I decided I wanted to do Mobile because of a project in specific, also,
                    since I used Android, I decided I would start with native mobile development for Android. I
                    researched what I would need, and so I decided to study Java first for backend, so I could work on
                    backend development, and learn mobile during it.</p>

                <p>What am I looking for?</p>
                <p id="content">At this moment I'm looking for my graduation and also trying to find an internship or a
                    job opportunity. Looking a little forward, I want to try on different areas, mostly on development
                    area, as GameDev, Fullstack, and even approach more to Cybersec. And for the bigger timeline, I want
                    to become a great person in this area, and make big things, build tools to help humanity.</p>
