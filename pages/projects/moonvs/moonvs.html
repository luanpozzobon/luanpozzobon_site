            <h1>The Project</h1>
            <h2>The Story</h2>
            <p>The idea of this project came to my mind before I even got to college, back then I used to write the movies I watched and rate them on my smartphone notes. Back then I used to make some things in Excel using VBA, and the idea was to make something like that. The idea never came out of paper, actually never went to a paper, and stayed just in my mind.</p>
            <p>After some time, I started to use the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">IMDb</a>, and I transferred all my movies, from the notes to their service, after some time I realized that the service wasn't getting all I wanted, so I looked for others, and none of them were doing exactly what I wanted.</p>
            <p>So, the idea came to my mind again, by the time I was already in college, so I could learn things there and put them into practice on this project.</p>
            <p>I really wanted to do this project, I wanted so much, that I started to think about problems I would have during the project, and so I didn't start it, because I was afraid it wouldn't be good, and it was important to me, so I needed to know what I was doing.</p>
            <p>I started the project once, but I didn't like the result and I just abandoned it, I still wanted to do it, but I decided to wait a little more, and I think I should have pushed more back then, but now I'm doing it.</p>
            <p>The idea of this project is actually what made me start to learn Java because I wanted to do a mobile version of this project.</p>
            <p>I kept the idea in mind, so I started to learn Java, I went after some research and started to think about what I would need, I researched some APIs, and decided to use the <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">TMDB's</a> API, because they provide the list of all services to watch the contents, and that was important to me, so I started to use their service, and I almost abandoned this project, because their service was good to me.</p>
            <p>Finally I decided to go ahead and start the project, this is the first time I'm doing a complete project, and it's been challenging actually, but it's nice.</p>
            <p>What does this project mean to me? Well I don't know how to explain it, but yesterday I spent the whole afternoon, trying to make the logo (you can check the 'Logo' tab, where I talked a little), and I actually liked it, so I'll try to focus on it.</p>
            <h2>The Name</h2>
            <p>I always thought I should name this project because it was special, it wasn't something I was doing to learn, or for work, or college, but it was something mine, something that had come with me since high school, so I decided to give a name, it wasn't easy to do so, at least not easier than to make the logo, I didn't want a common name, I tried to find good names online there was a site I used to generate project names based on the description, but I didn't liked any of the names there, so I had to choose it from my mind.</p>
            <p>The name of the project is a combination of 'Moon' and 'Vs'</p>
            <p>Moon: The first part of the name is because of the moon itself, I always liked subjects related to space, I always appreciated the night sky, and one of the meanings of my name 'Luan' in Portuguese is "moon".</p>
            <p>Vs: Having decided about the first part of the name, I needed something that, connected the name of the project, with its actual purpose, which was movies and series, so I took the letter 'vs' which in my head at least will sound like 'vies', so making the name MoonVs, pronounced Moonvies.</p>
            <p>Initially the name was Moonvies.</p>
